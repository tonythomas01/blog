Thanks to my 'techie' friend Rahul N for the simple hack. If you haven't received the same:



	
  1. Go to play store -> My Apps

	
  2. Motorola Update service[1] -> update

	
  3. Once done. Navigate to Settings -> About Phone -> Phone Updates


There you go ;) Simple as that. No added complexities! Please keep that service updated so that you will get any further updates.
