Official notice that I have changed my Blog name from ** Through the Pages ** to ** Open and Free Source **. Almost three years pass since I have started writing in this blog - and it looks like a long story ! I still remember by first few days at FOSS@Amrita ( our club ) where our mentor Vipin Sir told us to start a fresh technical blog and get maximum hit counts within a month. I was one among the early starters, but lost momentum in between. I am happy to say that ** tttwrites.wordpress.com/category/wikimedia/ ** is now tracked in ** http://en.planet.wikimedia.org/**. I am sure you will find it useful following the same. In a sense we are all trying to bring up this vision
