Okey! After all those discussions in #jekyll and twitter, I shifted to this guy called ***IFTTT*** to automatically post in Social Networks when I submit a blog post. This hasnt been tested yet, but will be shortly as I submit this to Github. 

## How to get this done
* Create an account in [https://ifttt.com](https://ifttt.com)
* Link it with your Facebook and Twitter
* Make sure you have your rss.xml at ***yoursite.com/rss.xml***
* Click on 'Add Recipe'
		
		If Change in RSS then Do post in Facebook &
		If Change in RSS then Do tweet in Twitter

* There you go. 

Cant wait to see if it works. Ciao
