Email service is a MediaWiki Component, which do not come pre-configured and requires some edits to the LocalSettings.php to set up. Basically, you are sending mails from your mediawiki running on your localhost/ or vagrant using the gmail smtp server.



	
  1. You need to install the following packages :

sudo apt-get install php-pear
sudo pear install mail
sudo pear upgrade MAIL Net_SMTP
	
  2. Now edit your LocalSettings.php to include :

$wgEmergencyContact = "apache@localhost";
$wgPasswordSender = "apache@localhost";
$wgNoReplyAddress = "user@gmail.com";

$wgSMTP = array(
'host' => "ssl://smtp.gmail.com",
'IDhost' => "gmail.com",
'port' => 465,
'auth' => true,
'username' => "user@gmail.com",
'password' => "yourPassword"
);


If your firewall doesn't check port 465 && smtp service is unblocked, you are ready to send your mail. Â In order to test, go to
localhost/mediawiki/Special:ConfirmEmail
and click on send Confirmation Code. Check your inbox ! :)
Instructions to check whether your port is open will be included in the next post.
