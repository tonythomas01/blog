This would probably be my first blog after movign to Jekyll, and I need to tell you that I'm happy about it :) Its great for me to type in my favourite text editor ( sublime_text as of now ) my blog entries, and publishing the same in quite few steps. 



Things I love about this model of blogging: 
* I can blog in low bandwidth 
* No more clutters from free/paid freemium services 
* Easy custom domain integreation 

and more imporatantly, 
		
		This block looks too great, and simple to create ( just 3 tabs )

What I would want more: 
* Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter integration - so that posts get automaticall published there too. 
* Hit counter ( it will have one, I'm surer )
* Nothing more. 

		The page is published now in http://blog.tttwrites.in 

I will shortly move the main domain tttwrites.in to point here. Stay Tuned.
