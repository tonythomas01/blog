March 08, the International Women's day, and since the rest 364 days of the year, never were the Men day, we decided to celebrate it out. In this days of discrimination an[![international_womens_day_vector](http://tttwrites.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/international_womens_day_vector.jpg?w=300)](http://tttwrites.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/international_womens_day_vector.jpg)d abuse, when girls are getting assaulted irrespective of age, our spiritual head and Chancellor, Mata Amritanandamayi requested, we form a Human-Chain from Karunagappally to Vavvakkavu, about 6 Kms. in length. The sky was hot outside and many of us, didn't felt like moving out, yet we went, considering it as a little service from our part to show the protest to the recent happenings to women abroad.

We left from our college, about 10:00 in the morning, and this time, it was the girls sitting and the guys standing, you know, 'Its womens day, right ?' The bus trip was awesome, like its always is, when a bunch of college youth gets into :). We re[![65538_625907117435282_2133510029_n](http://tttwrites.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/65538_625907117435282_2133510029_n.jpg?w=300)](http://tttwrites.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/65538_625907117435282_2133510029_n.jpg)ached our spot by about 10:30, the Karunagappally town, got down and spread our hands forming the long chain. Lucky for me and some of my classmates, we found our shelter under one tree and it actually saved us from the intense heat of the sun. We stood there for about an hour enjoying for ourselves, with our classmates, and also keeping ourselves in the venture. Later by about 11:30, we returned in another bus, again we sang and howled a lot and the day became again a memorable one.

Today, the question is again, "Are our women safe ? ". I know I am not any huge writer with wit or wisdom, yet having a sister of age 21,  I know the risks. My view is different and I like to think that things happen wrong to us due to our own wrong doings to a certain extent. Seriously, I am not  a sadist, yet that's my opinion. Small children getting raped, teenager molested and killed in the bus, all are of-course not at all due to their own fault, and I am at the point that the culprits should be punished severely and not hanged, you know hanging will make things too simple.

Sorry for the diversion in the topic again, like my each and every post, this too ends with an apology :D. Once again a Happy Women's Day and I would support for more womens day in an year :D. How would that look like ?
