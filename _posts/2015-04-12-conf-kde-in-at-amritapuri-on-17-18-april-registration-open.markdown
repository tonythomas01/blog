KDE is an international free software community dedicated to creating a free and user friendly graphical desktop interface and applications which run on Linux. CONF.KDE.IN is born out the simple idea - "Open Source for all". The conference emphasizes on the promotion of FOSS and encourages students to involve in Open Source projects. This year conf.kde.in 2015 is to be held in Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri, Kerala. It is going to be a blend of technology and unmatched beauty of the backwaters of Kerala. Amrita University is known for its enthusiastic FOSS club and active participation in diffusing the FOSS culture among the student community. It is indeed an ideal host for the event.
